# Module 6 Challenge - World Weather Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a program capable of generating a list of random cities around the world and obtaining weather data for each from an API. Our program uses the OpenWeather API service alongside the Google Maps API's to create a interactive map based on weather and location data. Our client, Jack, would like to be able to offer an app to their customers that would allow them to determine ideal travel destinations based on the user's personal temperature preference.

## Summary

Our program is capable of generating a random list of options, seen below.

The program then makes a travel itenerary based on the users top choices, seen below. The first image depicts a generated travel route while the second image depics top hotel choice alongside relevatent weather information for each city on the itinerary.
